## Chapter 1: Arjuna's Dilemma (Arjuna Vishada Yoga)

### Chapter 1, Verse 1

**Scene Description**:
A vast battlefield at Kurukshetra stretches endlessly under a dramatic sky. Two massive armies face each other - the Kauravas on one side and the Pandavas on the other, with thousands of warriors, chariots, elephants, and flags visible in organized formations. In the foreground, blind King Dhritarashtra sits on his throne in his palace chamber, his face turned toward his minister Sanjaya who stands beside him with eyes closed in divine concentration. Sanjaya's posture suggests he is receiving visions from afar. The scene should convey anticipation, the calm before the storm, and the weight of destiny. The lighting is dramatic, with golden-hour sunlight casting long shadows across the battlefield visible through a mystical window or divine vision. The overall mood is solemn, epic, and spiritually charged, representing the moment when the greatest spiritual dialogue in history is about to begin.

## Instructions for Adding New Verses

When adding scene descriptions for new verses:

1. Use the format: `### Chapter X, Verse Y`
2. Include `**Scene Description**:` followed by the description
3. Descriptions should be detailed (3-5 sentences)
4. Include:
   - Setting and environment
   - Key characters and their poses/expressions
   - Visual elements (colors, lighting, mood)
   - Spiritual or emotional atmosphere
5. Keep descriptions focused on visual elements that DALL-E can render
6. Avoid abstract concepts - translate them into concrete visual metaphors

## Style Guidelines

- Images should convey the spiritual depth of the Gita
- Use dramatic lighting (golden hour, divine rays, ethereal glow)
- Include traditional Indian visual elements (clothes, architecture, nature)
- Maintain a balance between realistic and spiritual/symbolic elements
- Each image should tell a story and evoke the verse's essence
